# Password Generator Starter Code
## criteria 
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

I found this module to be particulary difficult, it made me use all of my resources, yet I still wasn't able to get it fully functional. It will generate a password however it doesn't take in the inputted length. I originally had it laid out differently (I used charCode to try and get the random characters/numbers) and it ended up being a little much and I ended up confusing myself even more. On the other hand I did learn alot going through this activity. I ended up referencing Drews video to try and see what I was doing wrong. Next time around I plan on sticking around for office hours and getting extra help.
